## Description

This is a social networking and cataloguing app for your local rock enthusiast. Users can sign up to store a record of their rock and mineral collections, and to interact with others through with similar interests. 

When using 'What the rock', users can:

* Sign up for an account
* View rocks (all in database, or single specimens)
* View users and their rock collections
* View comments on specific rocks

When logged in, a user can access additional functions, such as:
* Adding and deleting rocks from their own collection
* Leaving comments - a user may try to help another user identify their particular specimen, or they may simply leave a comment to show their appreciation
